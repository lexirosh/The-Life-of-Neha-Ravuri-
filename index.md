# My Life
I am a senior at East Brunswick High School and plan on going to college after high school is over. I have a sister, who's currently a sophomore at Rutgers university and majoring in computer science. I was born on October 28, 2003 in Hackensack, New Jersey, and am currently 16 years old and live in East Brunswick, New Jersey. I like volunteering with the Youth Council and in an organization called Buddy Ball.
